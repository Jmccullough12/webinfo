These are open office hours, but notification that you plan to attend is helpful. Open office hours are first-come-first-served so there may be a delay in seeing you, but we are usually able to see everyone who comes.

If none of these zoom meeting times are convenient please help [help@carc.unm.edu](mailto://help@carc.unm.edu) to make an appointment.
