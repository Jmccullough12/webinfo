## Office Hours

---
The Center for Advanced Research Computing offers weekly office hours where CARC users can come for help. Office hours are first-come-first-served so there may be a delay in seeing you, but we are usually able to see everyone who comes.

**Office hours on Wednesday, April 27th are cancelled due to a conflict.**

Office Hours with Prof. Matthew Fricke are on Wednesdays from 10:00 to 11:00am and Thursdays from 2:00 to 3:00pm MT via Zoom. The Zoom link is [https://unm.zoom.us/j/4232179831](https://unm.zoom.us/j/4232179831).

Graduate student Kevin Fotso's office hours are on Tuesdays at 01:00 to 02:00pm MT via Zoom. The link for Kevin's office hours is https://unm.zoom.us/j/99653166024.
